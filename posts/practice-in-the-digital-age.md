## Practice Makes Perfect

What is it about practicing that progresses us closer to the ideal? If we look to the real world, practice is most commonly associated with sports. Sports have been a staple for inspiring stories because often times they are so relatable.

Athletes both young and old spend hours every day working through drills/plays. Why does this matter? The time allows them to become comfortable with the movements of their bodies. Out in the fields or on the courts, they are enduring environmental conditions like heat, cold, dirt, mud, ice, rain, or shine.

Many perform dry-runs to explore their physical limits. Failure is a very real possibility, but failing while practicing shows where further improvements must be made. It hones them in towards becoming the best they can be.

Practicing allows for these athletes to evolve into better versions of themselves. All of this preparation is done for game day. Skills are put to the test. Experts and champions emerge in their respective fields.

## Falling Out of Practice

This is all easily understood because we can actually realize the potential and power these athletes hold. For instance, if the goal on game day is to beat the other team by running around the bases more times or out-lifting the competitor's weight, it is easy for anyone to observe victory. We feel like a part of the game when our team scores because we know what is at stake and almost envision ourselves stepping into the ring one day.

The truth, though, is we are human. The abilities to transform ourselves and get skillful at any given activity can quickly backfire. Without someone constantly driving us to and from the practice/game, we tend to shy away from the sweat and failure and pressure to perform at our peak. An injury or traumatic experience could mean missing out on that important next step like a full scholarship at a top school. When the finish line is right there within reach, the smallest slip can mean huge losses.

## Put Me In Coach

A loss of momentum and traction is more than just physical at this point, it is psychological. And, confidence in one's abilities is a whole different ball game. If an ice skater is constantly falling, they are going to be frustrated when forced to slow down and return to the fundamental techniques. But it is a must before learning to pull off more challenging manuevers.

Is it possible to recognize by ourselves if we are falling too much? When we have a fast feedback loop, like the experience of pain after hitting the ground, we may realize it on our own. Often it requires the perspective of a coach, or mentor, to tell us when we need to slow it down or focus on a particular area. They help set the boundaries which enable growth to the next level.

## Constantly Moving The Goalposts

Aspects of physical strength, independence, and aptitude can be fairly measured in the real world. But therein lies the dilemma with the digital realm. Ideas do not hit triple axels, people do. How does anyone know when they are falling down too much? The feedback loops in the digital age tend to be arbitrary and slow, dampened from the immediate pains of failure. Our own expectations may begin to feel fabricated as frustration ensues.

On this slippery slope, the real pain is existential as the goals are always moving targets. We in software use loose concepts like insight, growth, innovation, productivity, and expertise in our everyday vernacular. It conveys potential value and encourages us to think harder. But, inspiration is not equivalent to perspiration. And when the modern colosseum is as large as the online universe with too many players to count, it can feel like a never-ending battle with no real gains won or any end in sight.

## Practice What You Preach

In this aimlessness, we have partially lost what it means to practice well. So what is a good fallback plan? What fundamental techniques and concepts do we return to when we fail? The answer comes down to

an individual's strengths and weaknesses. As a skill is like a muscle, any particular muscle group (or skill set) needs to be worked out to be kept strong.

We often take language for granted once we can do it instinctually. Still, there are some members just learning how to talk for the first time or that may only speak in short phrases. And how quickly we forget while conversing that communication is a spectrum in our society!
