## Practice Makes Perfect

What is it about practicing that progresses us closer to the ideal? If we look to the real world, practice is most commonly associated with sports. Sports have been a staple for inspiring stories because often times they are so relatable.

Athletes both young and old spend hours every day working through drills/plays. Why does this matter? The time allows them to become comfortable with the movements of their bodies. Out in the fields or on the courts, they are enduring environmental conditions like heat, cold, dirt, mud, ice, rain, or shine.

Many perform dry-runs to explore their physical limits. Failure is a very real possibility, but failing while practicing shows where further improvements must be made. It hones them in towards becoming the best they can be.

Practicing allows for these athletes to evolve into better versions of themselves. All of this preparation is done for game day. Skills are put to the test. Experts and champions emerge in their respective fields.

## Falling Out of Practice

This is all easily understood because we can actually realize the potential and power these athletes hold. For instance, if the goal on game day is to beat the other team by running around the bases more times or out-lifting the competitor's weight, it is easy for anyone to observe victory. We feel like a part of the game when our team scores because we know what is at stake and almost envision ourselves stepping into the ring one day.

The truth, though, is we are human. The abilities to transform ourselves and get skillful at any given activity can quickly backfire. Without someone constantly driving us to and from the practice/game, we tend to shy away from the sweat and failure and pressure to perform at our peak. An injury or traumatic experience could mean missing out on that important next step like a full scholarship at a top school. When the finish line is right there within reach, the smallest slip can mean huge losses.

## Constantly Moving The Goalposts

Any loss of momentum and traction is more than just physical at this point, it is psychological. And, confidence in one's true abilities is a whole different ball game. If someone is constantly falling, they may have to learn how to walk again before getting back to running. They have to realize slowing down is the first step. But even that is based on whatever expectation we hold for ourselves.

Therein lies the trouble with the digital realm. There is literally no solid ground to stand on. So we must fabricate our own expectations within the constructs of human society. The goal is always a moving target. We use the terms insight, growth, innovation, and expertise in our everyday vernacular because it conveys potential value and inspires us to act. But, ideas do not run around bases or lift weights, people do. But when the stadium is as large as the online universe with too many players to count, it can feel like a never-ending battle with no real gains won or any end in sight.

In this aimlessness, we have lost what it means to practice well. What even are the best-practices when no one has the time or patience to practice anymore? As our knowledge continuously slips to focus on the next big demand we try to juggle, we have mentally lost touch with our own competencies.

## Practice What You Preach
